# Timber Game Recreation

This project is a modern C++ recreation of the classic 2D game **Timber**, incorporating all essential dynamics and features. The game simulates the fast-paced action of chopping down trees while avoiding collisions with falling branches. It showcases skills in C++ programming, object-oriented design, and game development.

## Features

- **Player Movement**: Control the character to chop trees while swiftly moving left or right to avoid hazards.
- **Tree Movement and Random Selection**: Dynamic tree falling mechanics with random tree selection, providing a varied and challenging gameplay experience.
- **Collision Detection**: Robust collision handling to detect when the player is hit by a falling branch, ending the game.
- **Game Over Detection and Time Management**: Game state monitoring to detect the player's death, with time-based challenges that increase difficulty over time.
