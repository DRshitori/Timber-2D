This project is a modern C++ recreation of the classic 2D game **Timber**, incorporating all essential dynamics and features. The game simulates the fast-paced action of chopping down trees while avoiding collisions with falling branches. It showcases skills in C++ programming, object-oriented design, and game development.

## Features

- **Player Movement**: Control the character to chop trees while swiftly moving left or right to avoid hazards.
- **Tree Movement and Random Selection**: Dynamic tree falling mechanics with random tree selection, providing a varied and challenging gameplay experience.
- **Collision Detection**: Robust collision handling to detect when the player is hit by a falling branch, ending the game.
- **Game Over Detection and Time Management**: Game state monitoring to detect the player's death, with time-based challenges that increase difficulty over time.
- **Pause and Resume Functionality**: Ability to pause and resume the game at any time, allowing players to take breaks without losing progress.
- **Game Input Handling**: Comprehensive input handling for player actions, game pausing, and other controls.
- **Music and Sound Handling**: Integration of sound effects and background music, with proper management of audio buffers for a seamless experience.

## Requirements

- A C++ compiler that supports C++11 or higher.
- [SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library)](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) for graphics, audio, and input handling.


## Gameplay Instructions

### Movement
- Use the **left arrow key** or **'A' key** to move the character left.
- Use the **right arrow key** or **'D' key** to move the character right.

### Pause and Resume
